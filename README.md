# Course: The R Programming Environment

In R, it is important to recognize that there are differences betweent the R
object itself and what is actually printed to the console. There are many
functions in R that print in a very "human-intuitive" manner, with bells and 
whistles that aren't part of the R object itself.

There are 5 "atomic" classes in R:
1. character
2. numeric
3. integer
4. complex
5. logical/boolean

Vectors in R can only contain objects of the same class (lists being the
exception to the rule).

Number in R are generally double precision floating point numbers,
even if they are represented as integers (i.e. a `1` is actually a `1.00`). If
you would specifically like an integer, you must specify the 'L' suffix:

```R
# x is a numeric object (double float)
x <- 1

# x is an integer
x <- 1L
```
